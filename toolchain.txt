Full Static Analysis Toolchain (Summer 2019; 7/24/19)

This directory structure will be created as a result of running run.py on a module:

/[project]
.   /[module]
.   .    /csv
.   .    .   /4     (a folder only for each grade present in the metadata CSV)
.   .    .   /5
.   .    .   /6
.   .    .   /7
.   .    .   /8
.   .    /graphs
.   .    .   /pngs
.   .    /json_files_by_studio

If the necessary python3 modules are installed (explained in README.md), 
and "metadata.csv" includes Scratch studio URLs for that module,
the following command should work:
python3 run.py project [module] [--verbose/-v]

Additionally, run.py could be ran with only the project argument,
and will search for *project* + "-metadata.csv" and analyze all modules with information
